        "longDescription": "From rather humble beginnings as the Personal Home Page scripting language, PHP has found its way into almost every server, corporation, and dev shop in the world. On an average day, somewhere between 500,000 and 2 million coders do something in PHP. Even when you use a well-understood language like PHP, building a modern web application requires tools that decrease development time and cost while improving code quality. Frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails and Django have been getting a lot of attention as a result.     For PHP coders, the Zend Framework offers that same promise without the need to move away from PHP. This powerful collection of components can be used in part or as a whole to speed up the development process. Zend Framework has the backing of Zend Technologies; the driving force behind the PHP programming language in which it is written. The first production release of the Zend Framework became available in July of 2007.    Zend Framework in Action is a comprehensive tutorial that shows how to use the Zend Framework to create web-based applications and web services. This book takes you on an over-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as you build a high quality, real-world web application. This book is organized around the techniques you'll use every day as a web developer \"data handling, forms, authentication, and so forth. As you follow the running example, you'll learn to build interactive Ajax-driven features into your application without sacrificing nuts-and-bolts considerations like security and performance.  This book is aimed at the competent PHP developer who wants to master framework-driven web development. Zend Framework in Action goes beyond the docs but still provides quick access to the most common topics encountered in the development of web applications.  ",

        "longDescription": "In the demo, a hip designer, a sharply-dressed marketer, and a smiling, relaxed developer sip lattes and calmly discuss how Flex is going to make customers happy and shorten the workday   all while boosting the bottom line. The software systems they're using have been carefully selected and built from the ground up to work together seamlessly. There are no legacy systems, data, or competing business concerns to manage.    Cut to reality.    You're a Java developer. The marketing guy tells you that \"corporate\" wants a Flex-based site and you have to deliver it on top of what you already have. Your budget  Don't even ask. \"Make it look like the Discovery channel or something.\"    Flex on Java assumes you live in the real world   not the demo. This unique book shows you how to refactor an existing web application using the server-side you already know. You'll learn to use Flex 3 in concert with Spring, EJB 3, POJOs, JMS, and other standard technologies. Wherever possible, the examples use free or open source software.    The authors start with a typical Java web app and show you how to add a rich Flex interface. You also learn how to integrate Flex into your server-side Java via the BlazeDS framework, Adobe's open-source remoting and web messaging technology for Flex.    The book shows you how to deploy to not only the web but also to the desktop using the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR). You will learn how to integrate Flex into your existing applications in order to build a next generation application that will delight users.    Flex on Java is approachable for anyone beginning Java and Flex development.    ",

        "longDescription": "Although several options exist for interface development in Java, even popular UI toolkits like Swing have been notoriously complex and difficult to use. Griffon, an agile framework that uses Groovy to simplify Swing, makes UI development dramatically faster and easier. In many respects, Griffon is for desktop development what Grails is for web development. While it's based on Swing, its declarative style and approachable level of abstraction is instantly familiar to developers familiar with other technologies such as Flex or JavaFX.    Griffon in Action is a comprehensive tutorial written for Java developers who want a more productive approach to UI development. In this book, you'll immediately dive into Griffon. After a Griffon orientation and a quick Groovy tutorial, you'll start building examples that explore Griffon's high productivity approach to Swing development. One of the troublesome parts of Swing development is the amount of Java code that is required to get a simple application off the ground.    You'll learn how SwingBuilder (and its cousin builders) present a very palatable alternative in the form of a DSL geared towards building graphical user interfaces. Pair it up with the convention over configuration paradigm, a well tested and tried application source structure (based on Grails) and you have a recipe for quick and effective Swing application development. Griffon in Action covers declarative view development, like the one provided by JavaFX Script, as well as the structure, architecture and life cycle of Java application development",

Enterprise OSGi addresses several shortcomings of existing enterprise platforms, such as allowing the creation of better maintainable and extensible applications, and provide a simpler, easier-to-use, light-weight solution to enterprise software development.",
        "longDescription": "A good application framework greatly simplifies a developer's task by providing reusable code modules that solve common, tedious, or complex tasks. Writing a great framework requires an extraordinary set of skills-ranging from deep knowledge of a programming language and target platform to a crystal-clear view of the problem space where the applications to be developed using the framework will be used.    OSGi Application Frameworks shows a Java developer how to build frameworks based on the OSGi service platform. OSGi, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular applications, is a great tool for framework building. A framework itself, OSGi allows the developer to create a more intuitive, modular framework by isolating many of the key challenges the framework developer faces.    This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces the fundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworks that can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications. This book teaches the developer to break down a problem domain into its abstractions and then use OSGi to create a modular framework solution. Along the way, the developer learns software engineering practices intrinsic to framework building that result in systems with better software qualities, such as flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.    Author Alexandre Alves guides you through major concepts, such as the definition of programming models and modularization techniques, and complements them with samples that have real applicability using industry-proved technologies, such as Spring-DM and Equinox.",

        "shortDescription": "\"Flexible Rails created a standard to which I hold other technical books. You definitely get your money's worth.\"",
        "longDescription": "Rails is a fantastic tool for web application development, but its Ajax-driven interfaces stop short of the richness you gain with a tool like Adobe Flex. Simply put, Flex is the most productive way to build the UI of rich Internet applications, and Rails is the most productive way to rapidly build a database-backed CRUD application. Together, they're an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to build next-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex 3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDF reference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it's an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flex and Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!    With this book, you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it \"Flex Immersion.\" You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.    You will also learn how Flex and Rails integrate with HTTPService and XML, and see how RESTful Rails controller design gracefully supports using the same controller actions for Flex and HTML clients. The author will show you how Cairngorm can be used to architect larger Flex applications, including tips to use Cairngorm in a less verbose way with HTTPService to talk to Rails.    Flexible Rails is for both Rails developers who are interested in Flex, and Flex developers who are interested in Rails. For a Rails developer, Flex allows for more dynamic and engaging user interfaces than are possible with Ajax. For a Flex developer, Rails provides a way to rapidly build the ORM and services layer of the application.",

        "longDescription": "It's easy to get excited about building a new software project from scratch. So-called \"greenfield\" projects often involve learning new technology and the opportunity for experimentation. Working on established software projects may seem less glamorous.    Most software developers have inherited a monolithic application where the day-to-day tasks involve maintenance, incremental improvements, or even cleaning up the mess another programmer left behind. These legacy or brownfield projects often have tightly coupled components, low cohesion, and poor separation of concerns, making them fragile and resistant to change.    Brownfield Application Development in .Net shows you how to approach legacy applications with the state-of-the-art concepts, patterns, and tools you've learned to apply to new projects. Using an existing application as an example, this book guides you in applying the techniques and best practices you need to make it more maintainable and receptive to change.    Starting with the build process and the introduction of unit tests, the authors show you how to set up the application so that in later chapters, you can make incremental changes aimed at decoupling components from each other. Each practice introduced will increase your confidence and ability to make subsequent changes to your code.    As the book proceeds, the authors introduce frameworks and tools commonly used today while still approaching the subject from a conceptual level so that you can substitute alternate tools as appropriate. This book examines the reasons why a tool is necessary, not the tool itself. Because the book is based on the authors' experiences, Brownfield Application Development in .Net moves beyond the theories and shows you the techniques you need to be successful.",

        "longDescription": "Hibernate practically exploded on the Java scene. Why is this open-source tool so popular  Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you.    Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.    Hibernate in Action carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.    The authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate community every day - they know how to make Hibernate sing. Knowledge and insight seep out of every pore of this book.",

Hibernate, the most popular Java persistence tool, provides automatic and transparent object/relational mapping so it's a snap to work with SQL databases in Java applications. Hibernate conforms to the new EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence 1.0 standards.    Java Persistence with Hibernate explores Hibernate by developing an application that ties together hundreds of individual examples. You'll immediately dig into the rich programming model of Hibernate 3.2 and Java Persistence, working through queries, fetching strategies, caching, transactions, conversations, and more. You'll also appreciate the well-illustrated discussion of best practices in database design, object/relational mapping, and optimization techniques.    In this revised edition of Manning's bestselling Hibernate in Action, authors Christian Bauer and Gavin King -- the founder of the Hibernate project -- cover Hibernate 3.2 in detail along with the EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence 1.0 standards.",

It is an elegant persistence framework that maps classes to SQL statements and keeps the learning curve flat. The iBATIS approach makes apps easy to code, test, and deploy. You write regular SQL and iBATIS gives you standard objects for persistence and retrieval. There   s no need to change existing database schemas   iBATIS is tolerant of legacy databases (even badly designed ones).    iBATIS in Action is a comprehensive tutorial on the framework and an introduction to the iBATIS philosophy. Clinton Begin and coauthors lead you through the core features, including configuration, statements, and transactions. Because you   ll need more than the basics, it explores sophisticated topics like Dynamic SQL and data layer abstraction. You   ll also learn a useful skill: how to extend iBATIS itself. A complete, detailed example shows you how to put iBATIS to work. Topics are clearly organized and easily accessible for reference.",

It emphasizes steps called \"essential tasks\" which result in software specifications that show how each requirement, including robustness and extensibility, will be satisfied. All software developers and managers seeking to develop \"hard\" software will benefit from these ideas.    There are six essential tasks necessary for a good design:    User (run-time) requirements  Development sponsor (build-time) requirements  Domain information  Behavior identification and allocation  Behavior description  Software system architecture  Designing Hard Software goes beyond the standard software development methodologies such as those by Booch, Rumbaugh, Yourdon, and others, by providing techniques for a complete system architecture as well as explicit measures of the goodness of design.

Engines like Lucene provide a great starting point, but with complex applications it can be tricky to implement. It's tough to keep the index up to date, deal with the mismatch between the index structure and the domain model, handle querying conflicts, and so on.    Hibernate Search is an enterprise search tool based on Hibernate Core and Apache Lucene. It provides full text search capabilities for Hibernate-based applications without the infrastructural code required by other search engines. With this free, open-source technology, you can quickly add high-powered search features in an intelligent, maintainable way.    Hibernate Search in Action is a practical, example-oriented guide for Java developers with some background in Hibernate Core. As the first book to cover Hibernate Search, it guides you through every step to set up full text search functionality in your Java applications. The book also introduces core search techniques and reviews the relevant parts of Lucene, in particular the query capabilities.    Hibernate Search in Action also provides a pragmatic, how-to exploration of more advanced topics such as Search clustering. For anyone using Hibernate or JBoss Seam, this book is the definitive guide on how to add or enhance search features in their applications.",

Anyone who has looked at the demos and gotten a taste of what Silverlight can do knows that Silverlight represents an entirely new level of rich web interface technology for Microsoft developers. With Silverlight 2, developers can use JavaScript, VB, C#, Python, and Ruby to build user-friendly, interactive, and visually-dazzling web applications that work in most major browsers.    Silverlight 2 in Action is the first book to cover Silverlight 2, a far more robust implementation of Silverlight than the current 1 release that supports only JavaScript. The much-anticipated 2 release adds powerful new features along with the ability to code in multiple languages and integrate your work with Visual Studio and the new Expression suite of tools. This book delivers real-world examples and in-depth walkthroughs to help you confidently enhance your web applications using Silverlight 2.    Silverlight 2 in Action devotes extensive coverage to flexible layout components, the extensible control model, the communication framework, and the data-binding features   all cornerstones of software development. Author and Microsoft MVP Chad Campbell also describes rich media and vivid graphical and animation features. The final chapters include a variety of Silverlight deployment scenarios.    In addition to the fundamentals of Silverlight, you'll be introduced to architectural components such as the Silverlight object model. The book addresses the developer/designer collaboration model Silverlight enables, showing the developer how to include the designer effectively in the project workflow. This model is illustrated throughout the examples.    For ongoing reader support, the author will maintain a dedicated book-support website providing up-to-the-minute working examples, complete with source code, all in Silverlight.",

Shobana Jayaraman, Digital Infrastructure Analyst, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Library, The Tech Static",
        "longDescription": "Seam is an exciting new application framework based on the Java EE platform that you can use to build rich, web-based business applications. Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, scalability, and developer choice.    Seam in Action offers a practical and in-depth look at Seam from outside the walls of RedHat/JBoss. The book puts Seam head-to-head with the complexities in the Java EE architecture. It discusses the shortcomings of JSF, the challenges of using Java persistence in the web environment, and other common development roadblocks, then shows how Seam makes these problems just melt away. In covering Seam, the author doesn't just ask you to sprinkle annotations on your code and expect that you understand how it works. Instead, the author lays down the facts, shows you the steps, reveals the logic, and diagrams the flow, so that by the end of the book, you will not only have gained a deep understanding of Seam, but will also come away ready to teach the material to others.    All too often, developers spend a majority of their time integrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state, struggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions, and constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic pertaining to the business at hand. Seam in Action dives deep into thorough explanations of how Seam eliminates these non-core tasks by leveraging configuration by exception, Java 5 annotations, and aspect-oriented programming.    To start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant application come together by the end of the second chapter. As you progress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates unnecessary layers and configurations and uses an inversion of control technical known as bijection supplemented by a liberal use of the Unified Expression Language (EL) to establish the missing link between JSF, EJB 3 and JavaBean components. You also witness how Seam opens doors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not had time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page flows (jBPM), rule-based security, Ajax remoting, PDF generation, Spring integration, and more.",

But you may still be wondering exactly \"What is OSGi \"    Simply put, OSGi is a technology that allows you to create highly modular Java applications. It introduces a logical and physical module format, called a bundle, for explicitly structuring your application as a set of interconnected modules. OSGi lets you install, start, stop, update, or uninstall modules at execution time without taking down your entire system. In addition, OSGi defines a local service-oriented approach for creating applications out of loosely coupled components.    With the prevalence of modern component and service-based architectures, OSGi is becoming increasingly important. It meshes well with such approaches and greatly simplifies their creation and management. It's the backbone of Eclipse's plugin system as well as many recent JavaEE containers, such as GlassFish v3, WebSphere v6.1, and WebLogic Event Server. Even the SpringSource Application Platform is built on top of it.    OSGi in Action is a comprehensive guide to OSGi with two primary goals.

        "longDescription": "Cloud-based applications pose an intriguing value proposition for businesses. With an easily scalable, pay-as-you-go model and very small startup costs, the cloud can be a great alternative to systems hosted in-house. Developers are scrambling to understand the impact a cloud-based approach will have on current and future projects.    Azure is Microsoft's full-fledged entry into the \"Cloud Services Platform\" arena. Unlike other cloud offerings that address only one piece of the puzzle, Azure includes an operating system, a set of developer services, and a data model that can be used individually or together. It's designed to interact seamlessly with other .NET-based components, and leverages your knowledge of Visual Studio, the .NET platform, and SQL Server. It's also fully compatible with multiple internet protocols, including HTTP, REST, SOAP, and XML.    Azure in Action is a fast-paced tutorial intended for architects and developers looking to develop on Windows Azure and the Windows Azure Platform. It's designed both for readers new to cloud concepts and for those familiar with cloud development but new to Azure. After a quick walk through the basics, it guides you all the way from your first app through more advanced concepts of the Windows Azure Platform.    The book starts by looking at the logical and physical architecture of an Azure app, and then moves to the core storage services   binary store, tables and queues. Then, it explores designing and scaling frontend and backend services that run in the cloud. Next, it covers more advanced scenarios in Windows Azure. After covering the core of Azure, it introduces the rest of the Windows Azure Platform with a particular focus on SQL Azure Database.",

        "longDescription": "As organizations try to do more with less, development teams are less likely to be centrally located, tightly-managed, and permanent. Distributed organizations face special challenges when implementing Agile processes, which rely on frequent communication and responsive teams. Distributed Agile in Action is a guide to running successful Agile projects within geographically and culturally diverse organizations.    Distributed Agile in Action is the first book to directly address the unique task of going Agile in a distributed team. Rather than rehashing Agile theories, this book supplies the practical examples and step by step advice you need to help your distributed teams adopt and embrace Agile principles.

        "longDescription": "Due to the growing complexity of web sites, portals and portlets are experiencing serious growth. Portals help reduce complexity by allowing the dynamic aggregation and display of diverse content in a single web page. Portal components are pluggable parts called portlets. To be \"pluggable\" portlets and portals must satisfy standards. The authors of this book, all but one employees of IBM, created these standards: Java Portlet Specification JSR 168 and Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP).    The book starts gently with the basics of portlet technology and a functionrich portlet example. It then dives more deeply into portlets and J2EE, portlet architecture, best practices, and explores how the popular JSF web framework can ease portlet development. It shows how to set up an open source portal and create portlets that dynamically access backend data of various types. It is rich in something readers want: code examples that show them how to do it.",

The book includes step-by-step instruction for building dozens of code generators of varying types. These generators build high-quality output that is consistent and maintainable. Code generation abstracts the design of the code so that multiple outputs can be created from a single model of the application functionality, which means development teams can focus on higher-level design work and strategic problems, while still meeting goals for maintaining production applications.. The book covers techniques that range from simple code processors that handle common coding problems to more elaborate and complex generators that maintain entire application tiers.  Code Generation In Action covers building database access, user interface, remote procedure, test cases, and business logic code as well as code for other key system functions.    Although code generation is an engineering technique it also has a large impact on the engineering team and management. The book discusses the non-technical justifications for code generation in depth, and offers practical advice for making code generation succeed in any organization.",

        "shortDescription": "Many software projects fail unnecessarily because of unclear objectives, redundant and unproductive work, cost overruns, and a host of other avoidable process problems. In response, agile processes and lightweight tooling have begun to replace traditional engineering processes throughout the development lifecycle. An agile approach to application lifecycle management improves product quality, reduces time to market, and makes for happier developers.    Agile ALM is a guide for Java developers who want to integrate flexible agile practices and lightweight tooling along all phases of the software development process. The book introduces a new vision for managing change in requirements and process more efficiently and flexibly. You'll learn powerful practices like task-based Development, where you align activities into tasks resulting in traceable artifacts, Continuous Integration, in which you frequently and systematically integrate, build, and test an application in development and using Scrum as an agile approach to release management. The effect is a more comprehensive and practical approach to build, configuration, deployment, release, test, quality, integration, and requirements management.    This book synthesizes technical and functional elements to provide a comprehensive approach to software development. You'll learn to see the whole scope of the development process as a set of defined tasks, many of which are repeated daily, and then master the tools and practices you need to accomplish each of those tasks efficiently.    Because efficient tool chains can radically improve the speed and fluidity of the development process, this book demonstrates how to integrate state-of-the-art lightweight tools. Many of the tools and examples are Java-based, but the Agile ALM principles apply to all development platforms. As well, the many examples show how you can bridge different languages and systems.",
